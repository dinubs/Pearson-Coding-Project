The new laws make it a felony to intentionally access unauthorized information even if it’s been posted to a public website. The new laws make it a felony to traffic in information like passwords, where “trafficking” includes posting a link.\",\"You might assume that things would never become that bad, but it’s already happening even with the current laws. Prosecutors went after Andrew “weev” Auernheimer for downloading a customer list AT&T negligently made public. They prosecuted Barrett Brown for copying a URL to the Stratfor hack from one chatroom to another. A single click is all it takes. Prosecutors went after the PayPal-14 for clicking on a single link they knew would flood PayPal’s site with traffic. The proposed changes make such prosecutions much easier.\",\"Even if you don’t do any of this, you can still be guilty if you hang around with people who do. Obama proposes upgrading hacking to a “racketeering” offense, means you can be guilty of being a hacker by simply acting like a hacker (without otherwise committing a specific crime). Hanging out in an IRC chat room giving advice to people now makes you a member of a “criminal enterprise”, allowing the FBI to sweep in and confiscate all your assets without charging you with a crime. If you innocently clicked on the link above, and think you can defend yourself in court, prosecutors can still use the 20-year sentence of a racketeering charge in order to force you to plea bargain down to a 1-year sentence for hacking. (Civil libertarians hate the police-state nature of racketeering laws).\",\"Obama’s proposals come from a feeling in Washington D.C. that more needs to be done about hacking in response to massive data breaches of the last couple years. But they are blunt political solutions which reflect no technical understanding of the problem.\",\"Most hacking is international and anonymous. They can’t catch the perpetrators no matter how much they criminalize the activities. This War on Hackers is likely to be no more effective than the War on Drugs, where after three decades the prison population has sky rocketed from 0.1% of the population to a staggering 1%. With 5% the world’s population, we have 25 percent of the world’s prisoners—and this has done nothing to stop drugs. Likewise, while Obama’s new laws will dramatically increase hacking prosecutions, they’ll be of largely innocent people rather than the real hackers that matter.\",\"Internet innovation happens by trying things first then asking for permission later. Obama’s law will change that. For example, a search engine like Google downloads a copy of every website in order to create a search “index”. This sort of thing is grandfathered in, but if “copying the entire website” were a new idea, it would be something made illegal by the new laws. Such copies knowingly get information that website owners don’t intend to make public. Similarly, had hacking laws been around in the 1980s, the founders of Apple might’ve still been in jail today, serving out long sentences for trafficking in illegal access devices.\",\"The most important innovators this law would affect are the cybersecurity professionals that protect the Internet. If you cared about things such as “national security” and “cyberterrorism”, then this should be your biggest fear. Because of our knowledge, we do innocent things that look to outsiders like “hacking”. Protecting computers often means attacking them. The more you crack down on hackers, the more of a chilling effect you create in our profession. This creates an open-door for nation-state hackers and the real cybercriminals.\",\"Along with its Hacking Prohibition law, Obama is also proposing a massive Internet Surveillance law. Companies currently monitor their networks, using cybersecurity products like firewalls, IPSs, and anti-virus. Obama wants to strong-arm companies into sharing that information with the government, creating a virtualized or “cloud” surveillance system.\",\"In short, President Obama’s War on Hackers is a bad thing, creating a Cyber Police State. The current laws already overcriminalize innocent actions and allow surveillance of innocent people. We need to roll those laws back, not extend them.\"}"], ["link", "http://www.wired.com/2015/01/president-obama-waging-war-hackers/"], ["title", "President Obama Is Waging a War on Hackers"]]

It’s an interesting assortment of projects from people as prominent as Ridley Scott and Shield producer Shawn Ryan. However, this time around “interesting” doesn’t necessarily translate into “good”—in fact, there’s only really one pilot that’s must-see viewing: The Man in the High Castle.\",\"As with Amazon’s previous endeavors into original content, this latest batch of pilots is being delivered via Amazon Instant Video en masse so that people can tell the company which show ought to get a full season. And while the new crop boasts a Civil War drama from Carlton Cuse (Point of Honor) and comedies starring Breaking Bad and 30 Rock alums (Cocked and Salem Rogers, respectively), The Man in the High Castle is the one most poised to be this year’s (now Golden Globe-winning) Transparent.\",\"The Man in the High Castle, adapted from the Philip K. Dick novel of same name and executive produced by Scott, goes back to 1962 to see what America would look like had the Allies lost World War II. In this alternate universe the United States has been split three ways: the Nazi-controlled east coast, renamed the Greater Reich, the Japanese “Pacific States” on the west coast, and the “neutral zone” in the center of the country.\",\"Written by X-Files veteran Frank Spotnitz and directed by Heroes’ David Semel, The Man in the High Castle manages to evoke a suitably unsettling tone while also introducing a large cast of characters in a way that, while not perfect, makes it easy to follow their storylines and make the last-minute cliffhanger have suitable weight. (Don’t worry, that’s not spoiling anything.) It’s so good you might even forgive Scott for Exodus: Gods and Kings.\",\"The show succeeds not only through the strength of its high concept, but also through its execution of it. It’s the kind of show that’s just familiar enough—World War II-themed dramas are hardly rare—that it’s easy to get into, but also a unique enough so as not to feel trite or old hat. Even if you have seen nearly every “America in the 1960s” show out there, along with every take on WWII, The Man in the High Castle is a compelling enough—and character-rich enough—alternate version of that time to make you want to see where this thing is going.\",\"There are problems—there’s some dodgy CGI in the opening sequence that pulls you into the uncanny valley just as the show is trying to introduce Nazi New York for the first time—but there’s also an integrity and understated quality that reads like confidence, like this show knows what it is. It’s an assured stride compared to Amazon’s other pilots, which feel desperate for love or attention at times.\",\"Moreover, of those seven new shows The Man in the High Castle is the one most easily imaginable as an actual series, the only one where you want the next episode immediately after finishing the pilot. To put a finer point on it, it’s the only one you’re instantly ready to binge-watch. When you’re talking about shows designed for Amazon’s platform, that feels like an important distinction to make. If Amazon wants to find something to stand alongside Transparent, or to possibly be its House of Cards, this is the show to push forward.\"}"], ["link", "http://www.wired.com/2015/01/amazons-new-pilots-high-castle/"], ["title", "You Can Probably Skip Amazon’s New TV Pilots—Except for One"]]
